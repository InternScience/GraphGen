Whole bacteria treated with protease failed to elicit HR, whereas bacteria incubated with protease together with $0 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m M }$ phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, a protease inhibitor) did (Table 1). Treatment of bacteria with increasing amounts of protease resulted in a decreased ability to elicit HR that correlated with the disappearance of harpin detectable in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Table 1). After centrifugation of CFEP at $_ { 1 0 5 , 0 0 0 g }$ for 1 hour, most HR-eliciting activity was found in the supernatant. However, when the cell suspension was brought to $3 0 \\mathrm { \\ m M \\ M g C l } _ { 2 }$ ,before sonication, most activity was associated with the sedimented membrane fraction. Gel-permeation chromatography of unheated CFEP also indicated association of the elicitor with a high molecular weight $( > 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ daltons) fraction, probably membrane vesicles (14). Only the membrane fraction of E. amylovora Ea321(pCPP430) reacted with an antiserum raised in response to harpin (15), further supporting the cell-envelope location of harpin (Fig. 4). "

It appears to have an open structure, which may explain its heat stability and sensitivity to proteases. A FASTA search (23) of GenBank for similar proteins revealed similarity only with other glycine-rich proteins, such as several plant cell wall proteins and keratins. "
