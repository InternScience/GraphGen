A proteinaceous elicitor of the plant defense reaction known as the hypersensitive response was isolated from Erwinia amylovora, the bacterium that causes fire blight of pear, apple, and other rosaceous plants. The elicitor, named harpin, is an acidic, heat-stable, cell-envelope-associated protein with an apparent molecular weight of 44 kilodaltons. Harpin caused tobacco leaf lamina to collapse and caused an increase in the pH of bathing solutions of suspension-cultured tobacco cells. The gene encoding harpin (hrpN) was located in the 40-kilobase hrp gene cluster of E. amylovora, sequenced, and mutated with Tn5tac1. The hrpN mutants were not pathogenic to pear, did not elicit the hypersensitive response, and did not produce harpin.

The hypersensitive response (HR) of higher plants is characterized by the rapid, localized death of tissues containing an incompatible pathogen (a microorganism that is pathogenic only on other plants). It is associated with the defense of plants against many bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and viruses (1). The molecular basis for HR is unknown, but physiological and genetic observations with bacteria suggest that the same factor that elicits HR in nonhosts also is required for pathogenicity in hosts (1, 2). Production of this factor is controlled by hrp genes, which are highly conserved among many species of plant pathogenic bacteria (2, 3). Functional clusters of hrp genes have been cloned from Erwinia amylovora and Pseudomonas syringae and have been shown to confer on nonpathogenic bacteria the ability to elicit HR after infltration of bacterial suspensions into the intercellular spaces of leaves of tobacco and other plants (4, 5).

The hrp gene cluster from E. amylovora (Fig: 1), contained in the cosmid pCPP430, is expressed particularly well in Escherichia coli (4). We report here the isolation of a proteinaceous elicitor of the HR from Escherichia coli $\mathsf { D H } 5 \alpha ( \mathsf { p C P P } 4 3 0 )$ and from E. amylovora, the bacterium that causes the devastating disease of apple, pear, and other rosaceous plants known as fire blight (6). We propose the name harpin for the HR-elicitor from E. amylovora and hrpN for the gene that encodes it.

Tobacco leaves infiltrated (7) with cellfree culture supernatants of E. amylovora Ea321, Ea321(pCPP430) or E. coli $\mathrm { \bar { \ D H } } 5 \mathbf { \alpha }$ (pCPP430) showed no HR, whereas leaves infiltrated with a centrifuged and filtersterilized preparation from sonicated cells of E. coli $\bar { \mathsf { D H } } \bar { 5 } \alpha ( \mathsf { p C P P } 4 3 0 )$ showed a strong HR within 12 hours (Fig. 2). The HReliciting activity of this cell-free elicitor

preparation (CFEP) (8) was heat-stable but highly sensitive to protease (9).

Further purifcation was achieved by holding the CFEP in a boiling-water bath for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m i n }$ and removing the insoluble material by centrifugation. The remaining soluble material was electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3). A protein band corresponding to ${ 4 4 \ k D }$ was uniquely present in all preparations with HR-eliciting activity (Fig. 3). Similarly, after resolution of the CFEP on an isoelectric-focusing (IEF) granulated gel bed (10) or by ionexchange chromatography (1 1), the fractions with HR-eliciting activity always contained a $4 4 - \mathbf { k D }$ protein.

The $4 4 - \mathbf { k D }$ protein, named harpin, was electroeluted from a preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12). At concentrations ${ \ge } 5 0 0 \mathbf { n } \mathbf { M }$ $( \geq 2 5 ~ | \mathbf { \mu } \mathbf { g } / \mathbf { m l } )$ , harpin elicited HR in leaves of tobacco (Fig. 2, sectors 6 and

Because supernatants from E. amylovora Ea321(pCPP430) or E. coli DH5α (pCPP430) did not elicit HR, we postulated that harpin was not secreted but rather was present in or on the bacteria. Whole bacteria treated with protease failed to elicit HR, whereas bacteria incubated with protease together with $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, a protease inhibitor) did (Table 1). Treatment of bacteria with increasing amounts of protease resulted in a decreased ability to elicit HR that correlated with the disappearance of harpin detectable in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Table 1). After centrifugation of CFEP at $_ { 1 0 5 , 0 0 0 g }$ for 1 hour, most HR-eliciting activity was found in the supernatant. However, when the cell suspension was brought to $3 0 \mathrm { \ m M \ M g C l } _ { 2 }$ ,before sonication, most activity was associated with the sedimented membrane fraction. Gel-permeation chromatography of unheated CFEP also indicated association of the elicitor with a high molecular weight $( > 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ daltons) fraction, probably membrane vesicles (14). Only the membrane fraction of E. amylovora Ea321(pCPP430) reacted with an antiserum raised in response to harpin (15), further supporting the cell-envelope location of harpin (Fig. 4).

Cell suspensions of $\mathtt { E a } 3 2 1 ( \mathsf { p C P P 4 } 3 0 )$ or $\mathsf { D H } 5 \alpha ( \mathsf { p C P P } 4 3 0 )$ in log-phase maintained their HR-eliciting activity for less than 0.5 hour and 1 hour, respectively, in the presence of tetracycline $( 4 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m l } )$ , an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Once cells lost

insertions to the left of hrpN abolish pathogenicity to pear and eliminate or greatly disrupt HR-elicitation. Flags indicate the orientation of the outward-facing $P _ { \mathrm { t a c } }$ promoter of Tn5tac1 $( 2 8 )$ in the tac1-1 and tac1-2 insertions. The two tac1 and K49 mutations were marker-exchanged into the E. amylovora 321 genome. The mutations abolished the ability of E. amylovora to cayse disease in immature pear fruit, to elicit HR in tobacco leaves, and to produce harpin; similarly, they abolished the ability of E. coli DH5a(pCPP43o) to elicit HR and to produce harpin. The effect of the K49 mutation on harpin production probably is regulatory. (B) Deduced amino acid sequence of harpin. The DNA sequence is accessioned in GenBank (#M92994). Amino acids confirmed by $N H _ { 2 } -$ terminal sequence analysis of the purified protein are underlined.

HR-eliciting activity, harpin was not detected. However, when the protease inhibitor PMSF $( 0 . 5 \mathrm { \ m M } )$ was included, the bacteria retained HR-eliciting activity and possessed detectable harpin for more than 2 hours. More protease was required per cell to destroy harpin produced by E. coli $\mathsf { D H S } \alpha ( \mathsf { p C P P } 4 3 0 )$ than by Ea321(pCPP430), suggesting that E. coli $\mathsf { D H } 5 \alpha ( \mathsf { p C P P } 4 3 0 )$ produces more harpin or degrades it more slowly, or both.

The ability of bacterial strains to elicit the HR in intact tobacco leaves is related genetically to their ability to elicit a $\mathbf { K } ^ { + } / \mathbf { H } ^ { + }$ exchange reaction (XR) in tobacco cell suspension cultures (TCSCs) (16); both reactions require the hrp gene cluster (17).

We tested the ability of harpin to raise the pH of TCSC bathing solution, an indicator of the XR (Fig. 5). Cells of E. amylovora, grown in rich medium and added to TCSCs caused an increase in pH of the bathing solution after 2 to 3 hours. Addition of purified harpin caused an increase in pH within 1 hour. Erwinia amylovora mutant Ea321K49, which did not produce harpin in culture, and strains of E. coli containing mutated hrp gene clusters failed to elicit the XR.

Harpin also was isolated from E. amylovora Ea321, which had been preincubated for 5 hours in an HR-inducing medium (18). Harpin from E. amylovora Ea321 was identical in physical and biological properties to that isolated from E. coli $\mathrm { \bar { D H } } 5 \mathbf { \alpha }$ (pCPP430). No protease-sensitive, heatstable, HR-eliciting activity， associated with a 44-kD protein, was seen in cell-free extracts from E. coli $ { \mathbf Ḋ \mathrm { H } } 5  { \mathbf Ḋ \mathrm { d } } (  { \mathbf Ḋ \mathrm { C P P } } 9 ) $ , which harbors the vector of pCPP430 (Fig. 3, lane 5). On the basis of the visual intensities of the 44-kD bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8), we estimate that Ea321 produces about $10 \%$ as much harpin as does E. coli $\mathsf { D H } 5 \alpha ( \mathsf { p C P P } 4 3 0 )$ .

The structural gene encoding harpin, designated hrpN, was located within the hrp gene cluster (Fig. 1) by hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the ninth to the fifteenth amino acid residues from the $\mathrm { N H } _ { 2 }$ -terminus of harpin (19) . The 1.3-kb Hind 'II fragment that hybridized was cloned into pBluescript $\ M \ 1 3 +$ (Stratagene, La Jolla, California) and designated pCPP1084. A unique $4 4 - \mathbf { k D }$ protein, which was immunoprecipitated by antiserum raised against harpin (15), was

Cells were grown in LB medium, harvested'by centrifugation, and resuspended in 0.1 volume of $5 m M$ potassium phosphate $( \mathsf { p H } \thinspace 6 . 5 )$ containing tetracycline (40 $\mu { \sf g } / { \sf m } 1 )$ . After incubation with protease (Sigma P5147), as indicated, at $\mathfrak { s } 7 ^ { \circ } \mathfrak { C }$ for 5 min, $1 0 0 ~ \mu !$ of each cell suspension was infiltrated into tobacco leaves. Leaf sector collapse was assayed at 24 hours. At the time of infiltration, portions of protease-treated cell mixtures were iysed, held'in boiling water for 10 min, centrifuged for 10 min at $1 2 . 0 0 0 g .$ and electrophoresed on a $10 \%$ SDS-polyacrylamide gel to detect harpin. Electrophoresis was done for 2 hours at $1 5 m \mathsf { A }$ followed by staining with Coomassie blue R-250. Cell-free supernatant, produced from the LB culture, was filter-sterilized and then concentrated with the Centriprep-10 (Amicon, Danvers, Massachusetts).

Samples from the preparations in lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8 elicited HR in tobacco leaves. Samples were prepared as described (8) and brought to 125 mM tris-HCI $( \mathsf { p H } 6 . 8 )$ $4 \%$ SDS, $20 \%$ glycerol, boiled for 3 min, then electrophoresed through a $10 \%$ (w/v) polyacrylamide gel with $0 . 1 \%$ SDS at $1 5 m A$ for 2 hours in a Mighty Small apparatus according to instructions (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, California). The gel was stained with $0 . 0 2 5 \%$ Coomassie Blue R-250.

HR in tobacco leaves or to cause fire blight in highly susceptible immature pear fruits (22). Both pathogenic and HR-eliciting abilities were restored to Ea321T5 by pCPP1084, in trans, and the resulting strains produced harpin.

DNA sequence data from the $1 . 3 – \mathbf { k } \mathbf { b }$ Hind II fragment revealed that hrpN is 1155 base pairs long, and it encodes a 385–amino acid protein (Fig. 1). The 15 $\mathrm { N H } _ { 2 }$ -terminal residues revealed by amino acid sequencing corresponded to those deduced from the DNA' sequence (Fig. 1). The deduced amino acid sequence of harpin (Fig. 1), which corresponded closely with the analyzed amino acid composition, reveals a glycine-rich protein with a high degree of hydrophilicity. It appears to have an open structure, which may explain its heat stability and sensitivity to proteases. A FASTA search (23) of GenBank for similar proteins revealed similarity only with other glycine-rich proteins, such as several plant cell wall proteins and keratins.

The properties of the E. amylovora harpin protein are consistent with numerous physiological observations that were made after the discovery in 1963 that bacteria can elicit HR (24). These have indicated that elicitation of HR requires de novo protein synthesis and production of a labile factor by bacteria in close proximity to plant cells, and that each bacterial cell typically kills only one plant cell, thus explaining the requirement for high numbers of bacteria to cause death of enough plant cells to produce macroscopically visible collapse of the tissue (1, 25).

The nonpathogenic phenotype of the hrpN mutation in Ea321T5 also is characteristic of hrp mutations in other phytopathogenic bacteria (2) and indicates that harpin is a primary determinant of pathogenicity in E. amylovora. That harpin has an essential role in both disease and plant defense reactions is puzzling but may be based on differential proteolysis or differential expression of hrp genes in host and nonhost plants (18).

Toxins, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, and phytohormones contribute to the virulence (degree of pathogenicity) of certain members of the important group of phytopathogenic bacteria that possess limited host ranges and produce necrotic lesions after multiplication in compatible hosts (26). The hrp genes, in contrast, are absolutely required for pathogenicity by these bacteria, which include species of Erwinia, Pseudomonas, and Xanthomonas. The conservation of the hrp genes suggests that the E. amylovora harpin may be the archetypical disease determinant for these pathogens.
